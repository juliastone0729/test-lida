## About the LIDA Project

The LIDA Project is part of PSU's ReImagine Initiative. ReImagine PSU is an intentional effort by the provost to provide space and resources to groups of faculty and staff to collaborate and design mechanisms addressing challenges and opportunities facing the university.

### ReImagining Linguistic Diversity and Discrimination Awareness

As the Portland State community becomes more diverse in terms of linguistic and social backgrounds, it is essential that issues of linguistic bias and linguistic discrimination be acknowledged and addressed. Our goal is to raise awareness of the issue of linguistic bias and the richness of linguistic diversity on campus. 

By understanding what attitudes, preferences, and biases are held about linguistic diversity by the PSU community members, we hope to support speakers of all languages and dialects by better understanding and responding to this issue. Ultimately, we hope to educate all community members about linguistic diversity and the biases that come with it to better encourage change toward a more supportive community for everyone.
